# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current calendar page displays events in both a calendar grid view and a detailed list view below. This feature will enhance the calendar by removing the individual event listing, adding calendar subscription buttons for major calendar platforms, and implementing search functionality to help users find specific events based on text, categories, and date/time filters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parish member, I want to subscribe to the church calendar in my preferred calendar application, so that I can receive automatic updates about church events and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display three subscription buttons below the calendar grid
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google Calendar subscription button THEN the system SHALL provide a subscription link for Google Calendar
3. WHEN a user clicks the Microsoft Outlook subscription button THEN the system SHALL provide a subscription link for Outlook
4. WHEN a user clicks the iOS Calendar subscription button THEN the system SHALL provide a subscription link for iOS Calendar
5. WHEN subscription buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons and styling for each platform
6. WHEN a subscription link is accessed THEN the system SHALL allow users to subscribe to the church's ICS calendar feed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor to the calendar page, I want to search for specific events by text, so that I can quickly find events I'm interested in without browsing through all events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display a search input field below the subscription buttons
2. WHEN a user types in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter calendar events in real-time based on title and description text
3. WHEN search results are filtered THEN the system SHALL highlight matching events in the calendar grid
4. WHEN search results are filtered THEN the system SHALL dim or hide non-matching events in the calendar grid
5. WHEN the search field is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all events again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing church events, I want to filter events by date and time ranges, so that I can focus on events happening during specific periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display date range filter controls below the text search
2. WHEN a user selects a start date THEN the system SHALL filter events to show only those occurring on or after that date
3. WHEN a user selects an end date THEN the system SHALL filter events to show only those occurring on or before that date
4. WHEN a user selects both start and end dates THEN the system SHALL filter events to show only those within the specified date range
5. WHEN date filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the calendar grid to highlight only matching events
6. WHEN date filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL display all events again

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interested in specific types of church activities, I want to filter events by categories, so that I can focus on the types of events that interest me most.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display category filter options below the date filters
2. WHEN the system processes events THEN it SHALL automatically categorize events based on keywords in titles and descriptions
3. WHEN a user selects one or more categories THEN the system SHALL filter events to show only those matching the selected categories
4. WHEN category filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the calendar grid to highlight only matching events
5. WHEN category filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL display all events again
6. WHEN multiple filters are active THEN the system SHALL show events that match ALL active filter criteria

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the calendar page, I want the individual event listing removed and replaced with enhanced calendar functionality, so that I can focus on the calendar view with improved filtering and subscription options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL NOT display the individual event listing section
2. WHEN a user views the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display only the calendar grid, subscription buttons, and search functionality
3. WHEN a user clicks on an event in the calendar grid THEN the system SHALL continue to show the event details modal
4. WHEN the page layout is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
5. WHEN the individual listing is removed THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing calendar grid functionality
