# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The calendar page currently lacks the site's header and footer components, making it inconsistent with the rest of the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church website. This feature will integrate the existing Header and Footer components into the calendar page to provide consistent navigation, branding, and site-wide functionality while maintaining the calendar's current functionality and design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the calendar page, I want to see the site's header with navigation links, so that I can easily navigate to other sections of the website without using the browser's back button.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display the Header component at the top of the page
2. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links in the header THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate pages
3. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the sticky positioning behavior for consistent navigation access
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL ensure the header appears above all calendar content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor to the calendar page, I want to see the site's footer with contact information and additional links, so that I can access church information and other resources without leaving the calendar page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls to the bottom of the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display the Footer component
2. WHEN the footer is displayed THEN the system SHALL include all standard footer links and church information
3. WHEN a user clicks on footer links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate pages or sections
4. WHEN the footer is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the rest of the site

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor using the calendar page, I want the page layout to remain visually consistent and functional after adding header and footer, so that the calendar functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header and footer are added THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing calendar functionality
2. WHEN the page is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and layout between header, calendar content, and footer
3. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design is maintained for header, calendar, and footer
4. WHEN the calendar modal is opened THEN the system SHALL ensure proper z-index layering above header and footer elements
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain the current calendar styling and color scheme
